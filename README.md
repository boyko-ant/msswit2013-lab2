During the workshop listeners will learn Windows Azure functionality for exchanging messages between different units of our system. The workshop uses an example of allowing remote employees that use slow, unreliable and insecure internet connections to access corporate application. Let’s assume that our company ‘Cows and Bulls Ltd.’ has its own internal application that allows tracking of time spent by employees on tasks assigned to them.  Let’s assume we must connect to the system remote employees that use notebooks and public wifi or 3g modem. VPN usage is unpractical in current scenario, but we can use Azure Service Bus secure message transfer with less effort.
